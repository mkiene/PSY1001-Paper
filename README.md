**<p align=center>An exploration of sleep, insomnia, and their impact on cognition.</p>**

## Research & Paper

My initial research is in the ``Paper Research`` directory, and the rendered PDF file is under ``Paper Research/build``. Similarly, my final paper PDF is under ``Final Paper/build``.

I've added multiple other sources than I've included in the research portion of my paper, since I felt it appropriate to refrain from using citations within citations. 

## LaTeX

LaTeX is a text rendering software that allows me to adhere to formatting guidelines and to easily create citations using BibLaTeX. You'll find my references listed in the ``bibliography.bib`` files in both the aforementioned folders.

For more information, you can visit the [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/help/documentation/) and [BibLaTeX](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex?lang=en) pages.
