\subsection{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Summary of Key Findings:} Recap the major insights derived from the study, including the critical role of sleep in cognitive function and memory consolidation. Highlight the specific impacts of REM and NREM sleep on cognitive abilities and the negative effects of sleep deprivation. Reiterate findings on the importance of sleep quality over mere duration in maintaining cognitive health.
    
    \item \textbf{Implications of Insomnia and Sleep Deprivation:} Summarize the consequences of chronic sleep deficiencies as demonstrated in insomnia patients, emphasizing the potential for long-term cognitive decline. Discuss how these findings relate to broader concerns about public health, particularly the risks of developing neurodegenerative diseases.
    
    \item \textbf{Potential of Sleep Interventions:} Briefly revisit the discussion on enhancing memory and cognitive functions through targeted sleep interventions, such as pharmacological aids and sensory cues during sleep. Consider the implications of these interventions for both therapeutic and enhancement purposes in clinical and everyday settings.
    
    \item \textbf{Ethical Considerations:} Summarize the ethical concerns mentioned, including issues related to autonomy, informed consent, and the potential unintended consequences of manipulating sleep processes.
    
    \item \textbf{Future Research Directions:} Suggest areas for further study, such as refining sleep-based interventions for memory enhancement or exploring the long-term effects of these interventions on mental health. Emphasize the need for more comprehensive studies to understand the causal relationships between sleep patterns and cognitive functions.
    
    \item \textbf{Final Thoughts:} Stress the necessity of maintaining healthy sleep habits and the potential personal and societal benefits of improving sleep hygiene. Conclude with a call to action for both individuals and policymakers to prioritize sleep health based on the findings discussed in the paper.
